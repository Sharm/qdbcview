qdbcview
========

QDBCView is a simple Qt-based DBC viewer.  

The main feature of this simple application is auto-detection of data types contained in table fields which allows user viewing DBC files through all World of Warcraft versions from very first alphas to latest expansions without manually defined data schemes and presets for each version of file.
